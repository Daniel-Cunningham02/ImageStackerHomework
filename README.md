# CSCI 325 Homework

* When adding something just comment what you've done and how you've done it so that we don't redo someone else's work.
* Remember git commit -m "Message here", git push, and git pull when working.
* git pull grabs the most recent changes and updates your local repository, so you probably want to do that everytime before you start coding.
* All input files are in the ppms folder if you have not already downloaded them from canvas.
* Stacker.h already includes the private member declarations. Public member declarations can be added when we need them.
* 

## What we submit
* main.cpp - Driver and user interface
* Stacker.cpp - implementation of image_editor class
* Stacker.h - Header of image_editor class
* If any additional classes are made, they are supposed to have their own file.

## Todo

- [ ] Reading one ppm file.
- [ ] Reading multiple ppm files.
- [ ] Averaging of the values between multiple files by creating three separate averages for red, green, and blue and then adding them together into the vector using the pixel struct.
- [ ] Writing the averages of files to a new ppm file.

* You can add other todos here if you think of anymore.
